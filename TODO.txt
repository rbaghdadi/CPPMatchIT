- make a matrix get operation that converts the two indices to a linear index
- create some debugging utilities (like print statements for user functions and stuff like that)
- need some non-extern stuff
- clean up the run function. Can I make it so that I don't need to pass in each thing separately
- create const char create_type functions (see NWMatchIT input function)
- fix compilation warnings
- need to actually deallocate memory at some point
- be consistent with user and extern (change to user)
- try to reduce the number of loads and stores that happen just because I pass things around as AllocaInst (for example, in the compute_num_output_elements)
- When I call underlying size, do I really want to be calling sizeof? It seems weird to call underlying size on a bunch of pointers
when all you really need to do is allocate space for the pointers.
- create output ComparisonStage for later parts of a pipeline (not just the first stage) and desperately clean pipeline
- if only a single element, need to make sure comparison stage is 2, not 1 (which happens if just do squared)
